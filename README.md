# OOP-BASED-COUNTER
I have built a customizable counter functionality for web applications using JavaScript. The Counter function allows users to create multiple independent counters on a webpage, each with its own starting value and associated buttons for increasing, decreasing, and resetting the counter value. The functionality is encapsulated within a constructor function, allowing for easy instantiation of counter instances with specific starting values. The implementation includes error handling to ensure that the required HTML elements exist on the webpage before initializing the counters. Additionally, event listeners are attached to the counter buttons, triggering the respective counter actions when clicked. The counters provide visual feedback to users by changing the color of the counter value based on the operation performed (increase, decrease, or reset). This modular and customizable counter system enhances user interaction and provides a seamless experience for managing numeric values on webpages.
